**Usage**

Category drop down to filter by categories. 
_I hope you don't mind, I took it upon myself and decided that the drop down menu should render the selected category without hitting the search button for a better user experience_

Search for keywords includes _both_ eventKeyword and eventName in each event.

scrolling down to 90% of the scroll bar will automatically query for the next page.

Changing categories, searching for keyword or eventName will set page back to 1 allowing for infinite scrolling again.

Emptying the Search form after a query will automatically query for everything in current category.
